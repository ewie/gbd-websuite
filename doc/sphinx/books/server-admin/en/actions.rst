Server Actions
==============

GBD WebSuite supports lots of different commands. In your application and project configuration you may decide which you want to use in your particular installation. Each action configuration requires at least the ``type`` property (the first word of the command name, e.g. for the command ``mapRenderXyz``, the type will be ``map``), and, optionally, an ``access`` block (see :doc:`auth`), telling which roles have permission to *execute* this action type. Some actions require additional options.

Here's a quick overview of supported actions (see :doc:`configref` for configruation details).

TABLE
*alkissearch* ~  provides interface to the German Cadastre Data (`ALKIS <http://www.adv-online.de/Products/Real-Estate-Cadastre/ALKIS/>`_). In particular, there are commands to search for Cadastre Parcels (*Flurst√ºcke*) by their address, location, owner name etc.
*alkisgeocoder* ~  geocoding for ALKIS data
*asset* ~ handles dynamic assets (see :doc:`web`)
