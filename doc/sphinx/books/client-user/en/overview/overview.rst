Overview
========

The GBD WebSuite is a web-based open source GIS platform. It includes the GBD WebSuite Server and GBD WebSuite Client. In addition to the classic WebGIS functionality, the GBD WebSuite is characterized above all by the modular and efficient integration of external applications and new functionalities which enables extensive configurations. The core libraries of client and server are kept slim indeed. The whole architecture is plugin based. The QGIS integration is also implemented as a plugin, which communicates natively with QGIS.
